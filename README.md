# Dockerized-WeatherApp-with-Flask-Kafka-Cassandra-OpenWeatherAPI
 The "Dockerized-WeatherApp-with-Flask-Kafka-Cassandra-OpenWeatherAPI" repository is a project developed as part of a Distributed Systems . The goal of the project is to create a web application for weather forecasting using modern technologies, including Docker, Python (Flask framework) for the backend, Kafka for data streaming between the database and the application, and Cassandra for data storage.  This application offers advanced features such as email notifications, historical data tracking, recommendation system, and stream management using Kafka. By leveraging Docker containers, the development environment is standardized and facilitates collaboration among team members, ensuring consistent technology versions and smoother workflow.  The repository contains all the necessary code, configuration files, and documentation related to the development and deployment of the Dockerized weather application. It serves as a centralized location for version control, collaboration, and sharing of the project with other developers and stakeholders.
